# ESP-Miner Development Guide for Agents

Welcome to the ESP-Miner repository. This document provides a high-level overview of the project structure, build instructions, and CI setup to help you navigate and contribute effectively.

## Project Overview
ESP-Miner is the firmware powering the Bitaxe open-source Bitcoin ASIC miners. It is built on the ESP-IDF framework (v5.x+) for the ESP32-S3 and includes a modern web interface (Axe-OS) built with Angular.

## Build Instructions

### 1. Firmware (Main Project)
The project uses the standard ESP-IDF build system. Ensure you are using ESP-IDF v6.0.2.

**Prerequisites:**
- ESP-IDF v6.0.2 environment sourced.
- Node.js (v22+) and npm for the frontend bundle.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Source the environment
. ~/esp/v6.0.2/esp-idf/export.sh

# Build the project (automatically builds Axe-OS and generates binaries)
idf.py build

# Flash to device
idf.py build flash
```
*Note: The Axe-OS frontend is automatically built, gzipped, and embedded directly into the firmware (`esp-miner.bin`) as static C arrays as part of the main `idf.py build` process. The default build no longer generates a separate `www.bin` file.*

### 2. Axe-OS (Frontend)
The frontend is a standalone Angular application located in `main/http_server/axe-os`.

**Commands:**
```bash
cd main/http_server/axe-os
npm install

# Build only the frontend
npm run build

# Run local development server
npm run start
```

## Testing

### Internal C Components (Unity & QEMU)
Backend firmware unit tests use the Unity test framework and run under QEMU emulation (`esp32s3` machine target) in CI.

**Execution:**
```bash
bash tools/run_qemu_tests.sh
```
*Note: Test cases tagged with `[not-on-qemu]` (such as hardware-specific ASIC nonce tests) are automatically skipped in QEMU emulation.*

### Axe-OS Frontend
Angular unit tests use Karma and Jasmine. We use a specific CI command for CI environments which ensures consistent reporting and uses a headless browser.

**Execution:**
```bash
cd main/http_server/axe-os
npm run test:ci
```

**Key Points:**
- `npm run test:ci` automatically runs `npm run generate:api` before executing `ng test`.
- It uses a custom `ChromeHeadlessCI` launcher (defined in `karma.conf.js`) with `--no-sandbox` to ensure stability in containerized CI environments.
- Unit tests are highly isolated. **Reminder:** Components with many dependencies (like `HomeComponent`) must have all services, pipes, and sub-components explicitly declared or provided in the `TestBed`.

## CI/CD Setup

We use GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases.

### Key Workflows:
- **`unittest.yml`**: Runs both backend and frontend unit tests in parallel.
- **`build.yml`**: Verifies that the project compiles for all primary configurations.
- **`release.yml`**: Handles automated releases and binary packaging.

## AI Agent Tips
- **API Generation**: If you modify `openapi.yaml`, you **must** run `npm run generate:api` in the `axe-os` directory to update the TypeScript services. This is also automatically handled by `npm run build` and `npm run test:ci`.
- **Node Environment**: If `node` or `npm` are not in your global path, check for local installations in `~/.nvm`. You can source them using `export PATH=~/.nvm/versions/node/v[version]/bin:$PATH`.
- **Modern Angular Testing**: Use functional providers like `provideRouter([])` and `provideHttpClient()` instead of deprecated class-based modules like `RouterTestingModule`.
- **PSRAM**: Bitaxe heavily relies on PSRAM. Always check `esp_psram_is_initialized()` before allocating large buffers in the backend.
- **Mock Data Parity**: When updating `openapi.yaml` and regenerating the API, you **must** update the mock data in `main/http_server/axe-os/src/app/services/system.service.ts`. The TypeScript compiler will fail if properties are missing from the `of()` calls used for development.
- **API Type Safety**: The `SystemInfo` API uses a numeric 0/1 pattern for many boolean-like status fields (e.g., `overclockEnabled`, `overheat_mode`). In the backend, use `cJSON_AddNumberToObject(root, "key", val ? 1 : 0)` to maintain parity with the `integer` types in OpenAPI and support strict equality checks (`=== 1`) in the Angular frontend.
- **Reduce Verbosity**: Use one paragraph to describe changes. No headings, no "What this changes", no multi-line comments.
- **Reuse Existing Code**: Avoid refactoring and making large changes on your own. If a large change or refactor is required, refuse to make any further changes and alert your operator.
- **Minimize Scope**: If it's a contained feature, go for a PR and isolate the changes to that feature, minimizing the scope of the PR. If you have a restructuring of refactoring in mind, open an issue first to align it with ongoing changes.
